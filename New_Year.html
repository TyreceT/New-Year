    <h1 style="text-align: center; font-size: 50px;">New Year's Eve in the Philippines</h1>
    <h3 style="text-align: center;">December 31 - January 1</h3>

    <br><hr><br>

    <p>New Year‚Äôs Eve in the Philippines is a grand and lively celebration filled with traditions that reflect the country‚Äôs culture, beliefs, and hopes for prosperity. Unlike in other parts of the world where the celebration is centered on fireworks displays, Filipinos embrace a mix of superstition, food, and family customs. From preparing 12 round fruits for good fortune to lighting firecrackers to drive away evil spirits, each practice is deeply rooted in the Filipino way of life.</p>
        
    <p>Filipino New Year traditions are influenced by a mix of Chinese, Spanish, and indigenous beliefs. During the Spanish colonization, Catholicism played a role in shaping the celebration, emphasizing gratitude and prayers for blessings in the coming year. The Chinese influence, particularly in business-minded Filipino communities, introduced practices such as the belief in lucky fruits and wearing polka dots. Meanwhile, indigenous Filipinos have long believed in making loud noises to ward off evil spirits, which has evolved into the widespread use of firecrackers today.</p>

                <h3>üß® Fireworks and Firecrackers to Ward Off Evil Spirits</h3><br>
                <p>The belief that loud noises drive away bad spirits dates back to pre-colonial times when early Filipinos used bamboo cannons (lantakas) and gongs to scare off evil entities.</p>
                <p>Today, firecrackers (like "kwitis" and "sawa") and fireworks displays are a staple of New Year‚Äôs Eve, symbolizing the banishment of bad luck and the welcoming of new opportunities.</p>

                <h3>üëó Wearing Polka Dots and the Color of the Year</h3><br>
                <p>Wearing polka dots is believed to attract wealth and fortune because the round shape resembles coins. This superstition comes from Chinese influences, where circular patterns symbolize prosperity.</p>
                <p>It used to be a tradition to wear red clothes on New Year's Eve, as red symbolizes good luck, prosperity, and positive energy. Instead of just red, many Filipinos now wear outfits inspired by the Pantone Color of the Year, believing it will bring good luck and align with global energy trends. Each year, the color changes and influences fashion choices during the celebration.</p>

                <p>A common tradition among children is to jump as high as possible when the clock strikes midnight, as it is believed to help them grow taller. Some even take this superstition to the next level by jumping from stairs or elevated surfaces, hoping it will give them an extra height boost in the coming year.</p>
                <p> While this superstition has no scientific basis, it remains a fun and playful part of the celebration, especially among families with young children.</p>

    <h3>‚åõ New Year Countdown and Midnight Celebration</h3><br>
        <p>As midnight approaches, Filipinos eagerly count down the last seconds of the year. Families stay up late, watching TV countdowns or celebrating at home and in public events.</p>
